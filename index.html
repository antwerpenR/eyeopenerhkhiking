<a id="app-users" class="anchor" href="#app-users" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>App users</h3>

<p>EOHK does collect and share information that you have chosen to make public to members of the Eye Opener HK Hiking 開眼界行山隊 meetup.com group.</p>

<p>EOHK collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the phone type, language preference, and the date and time of each visitor request. EOHK's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how EOHK's visitors use its App and to offer features of interest through aggregation of such information. EOHK may show non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, eg, by publishing trends in the usage in the App.</p>

<p>EOHK does collect personally identifying information including name, photo, Facebook link, event participation and other information that you have chosen to share via the meetup.com platform. This is displayed and made available in a largely similar fashion to that of the Meetup.com App and/or the meetup.com website.  Additionally users of EOHK may download and make their own, personal, permanent archive of the information.  </p>

<h3>
<a id="business-transfers" class="anchor" href="#business-transfers" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Business Transfers</h3>

<p>If NPFE, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that NPFE goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of EOHK or NPFE may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

<h3>
<a id="privacy-policy-changes" class="anchor" href="#privacy-policy-changes" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>

<p>NPFE may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, and in NPFE's sole discretion. NPFE encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of EOHK app after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>

<h3>
<a id="limited-warranties" class="anchor" href="#limited-warranties" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Limited Warranties</h3>

<p>NPFE does not warrant the completeness or accuracy of the information published in EOHK; nor do we commit to ensuring that EOHK remains available or that the material on the EOHK is kept up to date. </p>

<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we exclude all representations, warranties and conditions relating to EOHK and its use (including, without limitation, any warranties implied by law in respect of satisfactory quality, fitness for purpose and/or the use of reasonable care and skill).</p>
