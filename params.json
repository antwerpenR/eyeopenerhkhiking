  "body": "### App users\r\nLike most Apps, EOHK collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the phone type, language preference, and the date and time of each visitor request. EOHK's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how EOHK's visitors use its App. From time to time, EOHK may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage in the App.\r\n\r\nEOHK also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users entering comments and managing their RSVPs. EOHK only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that App commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the App.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n",
